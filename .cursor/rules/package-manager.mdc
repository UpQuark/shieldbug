- Use Yarn instead of NPM for node commands
- Instead of generating something like `npm install @mui/x-date-pickers date-fns`, use `yarn add {thing}` instead
- If you get "The engine "node" is incompatible" or similar, try running NVM use "version" and then "NVM install (version)" followed by "use" if not present.
